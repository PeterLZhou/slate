# IOS

We currently support translating iOS apps, which store translations in .strings and .stringsdict files.

## Sign Up

Before you start translating, you'll need to [sign up for an account](https://www.langapi.co/signup).

## Install the CLI and login

> In the terminal, install the "langapi" node module globally.

```shell--all
#!/usr/bin/bash

> npm install -g langapi
> langapi login
```

To make it easy to translate apps via terminal, we've built our own command-line interface (CLI). Our CLI includes three main commands: **init, push, and pull**.

- init - Initializes langapi in a project folder
- push - Pushes translation requests to our server
- pull - Fetches completed translations

To get help on these commands, add the --help flag.

## Initialize

> To initialize langapi, run langapi init in the root directory of your ios repository

```shell-all
> langapi init
```

Run **langapi init** in your project's root directory. We will automatically detect your platform as iOS, and auto-generate some files, including a langapiconfig.json configuration file.

The **init** command may detect existing translations if you've already localized some files. Please only choose to load these into Lang if they are high-quality translations. We will internally mark them as human translations, and won't request any new translations unless the English strings change.

## Mark Localizable files

Before Lang can detect which strings to translate and which languages to translate to, you'll need to localize your project in Xcode.

**Turn on Base Internationalization**

Go to your project settings and check "Use Base Internationalization"

**Add target languages to Xcode**

Click the "+" icon under "Localizations", and add your target languages

**Localize your .strings and .stringsdict files for each language**

Lang can only detected files explicitly for localization. For each .strings/.stringsdict file, open the right sidebar and click "Localize...", and check all the languages you want to translate to.

## Update langapiconfig.json

> The langapiconfig.json contains your LangApi settings for the current project.
> Here, we've added Chinese (zh-Hans) as a target language for demonstration.

```json--all
{
  "originalLanguage": "en",
  "targetLanguages": ["zh-Hans"]
}
```

Now that you've added localization languages in Xcode, we need to add their language codes to the auto-generated **langapiconfig.json** file. To see what language codes to add, run "ls" in the root directory, and you should see ".lproj" directories generated by Xcode. Use the language code associated with each .lproj. For example, if you see "zh-Hans.lproj", add "zh-Hans" to langapiconfig.json.

## Request translations

> To push translation requests, use 'langapi push'

```shell-all
> langapi push
```

Run **langapi push**, and we'll parse all your .strings/.stringsdict files for untranslated content, and request machine translations for them. To request human translations, run **langapi push --human**.

## Receive completed translations

> To pull in translation requests, use 'langapi pull'

```shell-all
> langapi pull
```

Run **langapi pull**, and we'll gather all of your finished translations and inject them into your .strings/.stringsdict files.

## Finish

That's it! To test and see the the translations, edit your build scheme, and change the language/region settings to your localized language. If you have any questions or if any of the steps above aren't working, please just email eric@langapi.co and we'll respond quickly :)
